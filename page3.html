        <p>Linus’ contributions are all influential and relevant, which is impressive as all his projects were done in the 90s or in the mid-2000s. So, let's start off with why Linux is still a relevant contribution to this day. Linux is a massively popular system, in total there are about 32 million people (about twice the population of New York) who use one of Linux's distributions as their chosen OS on their desktops, which is 2.68% of computer users. However, the more impressive number is when you factor in the 1.6 billion users who use android, which was built off of Linux. Linux is also used in a multitude of sectors, such as software for servers, where 96% of webservers are run off of Linux, giving it complete monopoly in that area. On top of that 90% of cloud infrastructure also uses Linux to work, it is also behind the top 500 best and most rapid supercomputers ever built. Even SpaceX has used Linux to complete a large amount of their missions. As you can see, Linux has had an extraordinary impact on the world of computing and has made it possible to do those tasks. </p>
        <p> The creation of git was also massively significant for developers. Git has allowed developers to manage their source code in a massively efficient way, this is due to it recording all changes made to the code, throughout the entirety of a project, whilst keeping all states of the project from start to finish, allowing the developers to go back to a previous version of the program if necessary. It has also allowed for the devs to use branches and merges, allowing multiple developers to work collaboratively and not have issues with each of their parts on the same project. However, Git has more uses than just that, it is also utilized for scripts for databases, config files and management of content. The most notable is its popularity with devs as mentioned previously, this isn’t just an estimate however, as a survey found that 93% of devs use git which is entirely mind blowing how popular it is, but not surprising due to its versatility and it being completely free.   </p>
