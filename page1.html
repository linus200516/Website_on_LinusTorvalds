        <p>Linus was born on the 28th of December 1969 in Helsinki, Finland. His parents were Anna and Nils Torvalds, who neither worked in a related field that Linus would later come to revolutionize, however his granddad, Leo Tornqvist, was a professor of statistics who aided in introducing the first computers to their country, this almost paved the way for Linus to become who he became. At the early age of 10 Linus began to toy around with and learn how to use computers and how to program, this was all made possible by his grandfather's computer which was a commodore Vic-20.         </p>
        <p>Linus later went on to the university of Helsinki in 1988, where he learnt to code in a handful of different languages, one of them being C, which was extremely important when he eventually went on to work on Linux.  After his first year at university, he had to stop due to him needing to join the finish navy, as this was a mandatory service required in Finland. During his time in the army, he reached the rank of second lieutenant, his role being overseeing the artillery. Around the same time, he had purchased a book on operating system design and implementation, which as you can imagine played a big role in influencing him to start development on Linux. In 1990 he finally returned to his studies where he was first introduced to UNIX which played a major role in the development of Linux for a couple of reasons, like how UNIX impressed Linus, inspiring him to make his own OS. As well as how Linux was made, it took the simplicity and elegance of UNIX and made it into its own simple and elegant software. And finally UNIX's goal was to be open source and available to everyone for no fees or extra cost. All of these factors helped Linus decide to make Linux and helped him envision what he wanted his operating system to be like. </p>
        <p>Linus met his wife in 1993, her name is Tove, and when he met her, she was a six-time national champion in martial arts. They had met through a computer science lab exercise session, which Linus was running. He told the students to send him an email to test whether or not the systems were working, which led to Tove sending him an email which contained a message asking him to go on a date with her. His relationship with Tove is still going strong, they have had three kids, two of them being born in the United States. Linus is also completely atheist and believes that religion hold a lot of political weight in different areas, and he completely disagrees with this being the case, as he believes that is should be entirely personal, and have no effect on politics, mostly being notable in some European countries where there is a form of legal binding between the state and religion. </p>
