        <p>Linus created the Linux operating system in 1991 which when he released version 0.02, Linux was created by Linus and the FSF. Linus started to create Linux during his time in university, he was attempting to create an operating system that was similar to an already existing OS called ‘MINIX’, so as you can imagine MINIX played a big part in how Linux ended up turning out. In the year 1994 Linux 1.0 was released, and this was the first time it was a fully-fledged operating system. Linux experienced large growth throughout the 90s, this is due to multiple developers, who didn’t work directly with Linus, coming together to create additions to the great open-source OS that was Linux. At the time it was not as popular with regular users, due to it still being in its early stages, meaning it was mainly being used by enthusiasts, as it was not user friendly, but it was extremely efficient and reliable. Linux has also paved the way for people to make their own ‘distributions’ which has been going on since the 90s, where people have adapted the source code just to make a version more tailored to specific tasks and use cases, which is what we see today with distros such as Ubuntu, Black Arch, Fedora and MX Linux.          </p>
        <p>Linus also was the main developer behind Git, as he required a source control management system, to be able to keep control and track of the versions and updated being done to Linux. The reason why he started development on git is that the previous software he used to do this was proprietary and retracted it free license from being used on Linux, that software was called Bit Keeper. So, this led Linus to search for an alternative that was similar to Bit Keeper, but he was disappointed when he discovered there were no free alternatives that met all the needs which were required for him to keep on working on Linux. He had 4 goals in hand for his project with git, and those were: 1- patching should be done within 3 seconds. 2- use CVS and do the opposite to what it does. 3- work in a similar manner to the previous system being used. 4- have strong safety features to prevent issues that could ultimately affect the system. So, after sitting down and deciding the criteria, he started working on it in 2005 and within the same year, git was completed. </p>
        <p>One major thing that both of these project that Linus has worked on, both have one thing in common, and that is the fact that they are both open source, meaning that everyone has access to the source code, which has led to an influx of people who do programming as a hobby to come and contribute to these projects, ultimately improving the final product, allowing them both to reach the high standard that they have reached today.   </p>
